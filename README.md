### **1. Which product category had the highest sales?**

This query aims to identify which product category generated the highest revenue over the period analyzed. This insight can guide KMS in prioritizing inventory planning, promotional efforts, and supplier negotiations around top-performing products.

**SQL Query Used:**

#### Analysis: Which Product Had the Highest Sales?

```sql
SELECT Product_Name, SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Product_Name
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC;
```
#### Insight:
According to my analysis, the product Global Troy‚Ñ¢ Executive Leather Low-Back Tilter generated the highest total sales of ‚Ç¶275,941.520. This makes it the top-performing product in the entire dataset and a key contributor to revenue.

### **2. What Are the Top Three and Bottom Three Regions in Terms of Sales?**
This analysis investigates regional performance by comparing total sales across all regions. Identifying the highest and lowest-performing regions allows KMS to evaluate what drives strong sales in top regions and what may be hindering sales in underperforming ones. These insights can support better allocation of marketing resources, stock distribution, and regional sales strategies.

**SQL Query Used:**

#### Analysis: Top 3 Regions by Sales

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY [Total Sales] ASC;
```
#### Analysis: Top 3 Regions by Sale
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY [Total Sales] ASC;
```
#### Insight:

Based on the analysis, the **top three regions** with the highest total sales are **West** (‚Ç¶**3,597,549.33**), **Ontario** (‚Ç¶**3,063,212.55**), and **Prairie** (‚Ç¶**2,837,304.59**). These regions likely contribute significantly to the company‚Äôs revenue due to higher population density, purchasing power, and well-established supply chains.

Conversely, the **bottom three regions** in terms of total sales are **Atlantic** (‚Ç¶**1,167,627.86**), **Quebec** (‚Ç¶**1,359,364.33**), and **Northwest Territories** (‚Ç¶**1,447,390.01**). These low figures may indicate limited customer reach, operational constraints, or lower demand. KMS may consider targeted marketing, local partnerships, or revised distribution strategies to improve performance in these areas.

| **Low**           | 74.42%           | 14.53%              | 11.05%           |
| **Not Specified** | 76.38%           | 12.86%              | 10.77%           |

#### Average Shipping Cost per Priority

| Order Priority     | Avg. Shipping Cost (‚Ç¶) |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| **Low**            | ‚Ç¶13.34                 |
| **Critical**       | ‚Ç¶13.13                 |
| **High**           | ‚Ç¶12.82                 |
| **Medium**         | ‚Ç¶12.58                 |
| **Not Specified**  | ‚Ç¶12.32                 |

>  **Conclusion:** Low-priority orders are incurring **higher average shipping costs** than even critical ones ‚Äî a **major operational inefficiency**.

---

####  Business Problem:

This suggests a **misalignment between operational cost management and business logic**, leading to:

- **Increased logistics cost** for non-urgent orders.  
-  **Potential customer dissatisfaction** for delayed critical deliveries.  
-  **Missed cost-saving opportunities** on high-volume, low-priority orders.

---

#### Recommendations:

##### 1. Redesign the Shipping Logic Flow
Create a **rule-based system** that matches:

- `Critical & High Priority ‚Üí Express Air or Regular Air (based on SLA deadlines)`
- `Medium Priority ‚Üí Regular Air`
- `Low & Not Specified ‚Üí Delivery Truck by default`

##### 2. Implement a Shipping Audit Tracker
- Add a **validation layer** before final shipment to check if:
  - `Shipping Mode ‚â† Order Priority`, flag the order for review.
- Generate **weekly reports** on "**Priority vs Shipping Mismatch**".

##### 3. Automate Shipping Assignment
- Use **SQL-based triggers or workflow automation** in your ERP to auto-assign:
  - **Express Air only for Critical** or time-sensitive deliveries.

##### 4. Reallocate Budget & Reduce Wastage
- Redirect saved shipping costs from **Low-priority** orders to:
  - Offer **free Express Air upgrades** for **VIP customers**.
  - Fund **marketing loyalty campaigns** or discounts.

##### 5. Monitor & Measure with KPIs
Track monthly:
- % of **Critical orders delivered via Express Air** *(target: >70%)*
-  % of **Low-priority orders using Delivery Truck** *(target: >80%)*
-  **Shipping cost variance vs monthly logistics budget**

---

### Conclusion

KMS currently **overspends on low-priority deliveries** and **underutilizes Express Air for critical orders**. These mismatches raise costs, reduce efficiency, and risk customer trust.

> By **realigning shipping modes to match order urgency**, KMS can unlock:
-  **Smarter logistics**
-  **Cost optimization**
-  **Faster fulfillment**
-  **Data-driven automation for scalability**

---
